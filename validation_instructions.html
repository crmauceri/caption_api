<h1>Location verification task</h1>

<h2>Instructions:</h2>

<p>We are collecting a dataset which will help teach robots to find objects in cluttered and confusing locations.&nbsp;</p>

<p>You will be shown a series of images with a description of a single object in that image. Imagine that someone has given you the description and now you need to fetch the object. Your task is to <strong>click on the object</strong>.</p>

<p>For example, here is a typical image with an object description.&nbsp;</p>

<div> <strong>Description</strong>: The binder is on the top shelf in the corner underneath a box. <br/> <img src="http://arpg.colorado.edu/imgs/03068_org.jpg" width="700">
</div>
 
<p>We asked the annotators who wrote the descriptions to describe the object's location with enough detail that someone else could find it based on their description. <b>Please flag descriptions that don't describe locations or that don't make sense.</b><br>
&nbsp;</p>

<h2>Validation:</h2>

<p>You do not need to correctly identify every object. Because the descriptions are collected from the web, some might be difficult or confusing. If you can't find an object that fits the description, please use the "There is no object which fits the description" option. There should be no need to guess which object the description refers to.</p>

<p>We will insert some questions where other annotators have had high accuracy (gold standard). These questions should be easy to answer correctly.&nbsp;If you have difficulty with these questions, your responses may be discarded.</p>

<h2>Completing the Survey:</h2>

<p>The survey will store your progress. So feel free to take a break at any time. Just leave the page open and return later. Please complete the survey within 24 hours.</p>
